      "I also often worked on technical roadmap tasks designed to improve the robustness and maintainability of the software. These tasks were often related to the merging the two products Sonata Web and eTalis and taking the best approaches from both into the final result.",
      "Before I left I was asked to perform training of employees wishing to move to development of web-based products which used a lot of different technologies and patterns from the desktop applications they had worked on previously."
